:::{grid-item-card} Scale out from the very beginning
PyData London 2017
^^^

To shed light in the contents of a 1.5 PB storage solution I created a distributed filesystem scanner based on dask, which can be directly executed on the nodes of the server. The solution is executed every night to create a usable table of contents for all datasets available and also won't forget about what has been there once before.
