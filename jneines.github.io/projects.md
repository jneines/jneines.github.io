:link: https://github.com/jneines/mandel-bench
**Mandelbrot Benchmark**
^^^
A benchmark engine computing the mandelbrot set using several approaches implemented as engines. This was the base for my benchmark results for the [Accelerating Python Code](https://jneines.github.io/accelerating_python_code/intro.html) Talk at PyCon DE & PyData Berlin 2023.

**Mandelbrot Set Explorer**
^^^
A Mandelbrot Set explorer in a Jupyter Notebook using advanced acceleration techniques for computation and display based on
[numba](https://numba.pydata.org),
[bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/),
[datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader),
[dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/)
and its [distributed](https://github.com/dask/distributed) backend.
